# InformationSecurity

Implement a standalone program in Java to demonstrate the working of the monoalphabetic substitution cipher. 
The input text is plain ascii text consisting of English small case alphabets only without white space, to be read from a pre-defined file plaintext.txt. 
The program should generate a random 26 alphabet sequence as the key. 
There are two sub-routines in the program: Encrypt and Decrypt. 
The Encrypt subroutine will read the plaintext data from the plaintext file, generate the ciphertext and store the ciphertext in a predefined file encrypt.txt. 
The Decrypt subroutine will decrypt the generated ciphertext and store the decrypted ciphertext into a predefined file decrypt.txt.
At the end of the program, the user will open the decrypt.txt file and manually verify whether the contents of the two files plaintext.txt and decrypt.txt are matching or not.
